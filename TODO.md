## ðŸ”„ Current Status

### Issues Identified
1. **Backend Server Not Running**: Frontend is getting ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED because the backend server is not running on port 5000
2. **Authentication Issues**: Login requests return 401 Unauthorized due to missing users or incorrect credentials
3. **Database Connection**: Need to verify MongoDB connection and ensure test users exist

### Next Steps
- [ ] Start the backend server (`npm run server` or `node server.js`)
- [ ] Verify MongoDB connection is working
- [ ] Create test users in the database
- [ ] Test authentication flow end-to-end
- [ ] Test booking creation with real API calls

## ðŸ“‹ Testing Checklist

### Backend Tests
- [ ] MongoDB connection established
- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Authentication routes working
- [ ] Car routes returning data
- [ ] Booking routes functional

### Frontend Tests
- [ ] Login form works with valid credentials
- [ ] Car selection loads properly
- [ ] Booking form submits successfully
- [ ] Error messages display correctly
- [ ] Loading states work as expected

## ðŸš€ Deployment Notes

- Ensure environment variables are set (JWT_SECRET, MONGODB_URI, etc.)
- Verify CORS settings allow frontend connections
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- Confirm database is seeded with initial data if needed

## ðŸ”§ Quick Commands

```bash
# Start backend server
cd backend && npm run server

# Start frontend development server
cd frontend && npm start

# Run backend tests
cd backend && npm test

# Install dependencies
cd backend && npm install
cd frontend && npm install
```

## ðŸ“ˆ API Service Improvements

### New Features Added
- **Automatic Retry Logic**: Failed requests are automatically retried up to 2 times with increasing delays
- **Request Timeout**: All requests now have a 10-second timeout to prevent hanging
- **Better Error Messages**: Specific error messages for different failure scenarios:
  - "Unable to connect to the server. Please check if the backend server is running and try again."
  - "Request timed out. The server may be busy or offline."
  - "Login request timed out. The server may be busy or offline."
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed console logging for debugging API requests and responses
- **Graceful Degradation**: Frontend continues to work with fallback data when server is unavailable

### Error Handling Scenarios
1. **Server Offline**: Clear message indicating server needs to be started
2. **Network Timeout**: Specific timeout messages for different operations
3. **Connection Refused**: User-friendly messages instead of technical errors
4. **Authentication Errors**: Clear guidance for login issues
5. **Validation Errors**: Specific feedback for form validation failures
